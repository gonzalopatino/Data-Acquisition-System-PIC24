# Data-Acquisition-System-PIC24
This project demonstrates the use of a PIC24 microcontroller to read, store, and recall sensor data using ADC, with user interaction via a 4x3 keypad. It features a state machine for efficient operation, displays results on a GLCD, and supports UART data export, providing visual and serial feedback.
